# CrossProduct

This is just a C++ program I made for fun. I'd been working with vector cross products in Calc 2 and I had ideas on how it could be structured as code. There's doubtlessly ways this could be improved, but it's perfectly functional up to the limit of what C++ ints can store in memory, and I only made it for fun. Just download and open/build the project in Visual Studio to run it yourself.
